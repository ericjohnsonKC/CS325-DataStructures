In week 2, you were tasked to develop an application for a local dental care office. To do so, 
you were provided with the specifications that required the implementation of queue functionality. 

For this assignment, you are to use the same scenario, however this time, rather than coding all 
the required queue functions, you are to use QUEUE Container Adapter’s methods, and provide the implementation of a requested functionality.

Scenario:

A local dental care office has hired you to develop an application that will manage patient visits.  
Each patient will be put in the queue and will be called on a first come first served bases. 

Develop the menu driven Windows Console application with the following menu items:

1.    Add patient

2.    Next patient

3.    Previous patient

4.    Delete Patient

5.    View current

Patient management will be resolved by utilization of an STL-queue container’s functionalities and 
use of the following Queue container adapter functions:

1.    enQueue:  Adds the patient in the queue

2.     DeQueue:  Deletes the patient from the queue

3.    Peek: Returns the patient that is top in the queue without removing it

4.    IsEmpty: checks do we have any patient in the queue

5.    Size:  returns the number of patients that are in the queue

While adding a new patient in the queue, the program will be capable of collecting the following 
patient information:

1.    Patient first and last name

2.    Type of insurance

3.    SSN number

4.    Address

5.    Date of visit

 

Submission

1.    Create a Microsoft Word document name IP1_YourName.docx

2.    Take screenshots, with timestamps, of each menu item in use to show a successful compile and 
successful run. Paste the screenshots into the Word document. NOTE: Failure to provide screenshots 
with time stamps will result in a score of 1.

3.    Copy your code into the Word document. For each line of the code provide a description explaining 
what it does
