A local computer store asked you to develop a program that will manage the sale of computers 
that they have in stock. The program will be able to add information about new computers, as 
well as deleting those sold.  

Write a C++ VS console application to implement a menu-driven program for managing the computer 
store using binary search trees. When the application executes, all data about the available 
computers should be stored in a file named Computers. The data includes the code, name, 
Operating system, hard drive, ram, and price of each computer. Each field will be on a separate 
line.  Starting the application will cause the creation of a binary search tree, with one node 
corresponding to one computer. Each node will contain a computer code. In addition, by starting 
the program the user should be presented with a welcome message, the current date, and a menu with 
the following items:

·         Add new

·         Remove-sold

·         List all

You are to implement functionalities that will be capable of adding and removing computers as well 
as listing all computers that are available in the store. Please note that when a new computer is 
added, both a binary tree and a text file should be updated. Similarly, when a computer is sold, 
information should be removed from both the binary tree and a text file.
