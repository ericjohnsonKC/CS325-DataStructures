Data Structures – Week 6 Assignment
Graph Data Structures

Graphs are frequently used in social networks such as LinkedIn or Facebook where each member is 
represented with the vertex.  Furthermore, each vertex is a structure with the fields:

·         Name

·         Member ID

·         Gender

·         Status

Create a console application capable of managing members. It should be able to add a new member, 
delete a member, add a friend, and display a list of all friends for a member.

When started, the application will display a welcome message with the current date and the following menu:

·         Add member: Program creates new vertex and adds new member to the graph.  Member information 
consists of Name, Member ID, Gender, and Status saved in the structure. 

·         Delete Member: program deletes member from the graph

·         Add Friend:  Program adds the friend to the existing member

·         List Friends: Program lists all friends for the particular member.
